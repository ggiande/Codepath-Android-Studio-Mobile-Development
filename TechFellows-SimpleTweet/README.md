# Simple Tweet 

Simple Tweet is an android app that allows a user to view their Twitter timeline. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total

### User Stories
A user story is a way to capture requirements for an app from an end-user perspective. User stories are common practice in app development and help to simplify the way requirements are specified.

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  - [X] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  - [ ] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
- [X] User can refresh tweets timeline by pulling down to refresh

The following **optional** features are implemented:

## Notes

Some of the ecnountered challenges included the API only allowing for 15 API requests every 15 minutes, which then blocked the developer until the lock period ended.
